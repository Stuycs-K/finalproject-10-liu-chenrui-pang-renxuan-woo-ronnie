# Final Project Proposal

Brainfuck Interpreter (in 3 languages)

## Group Members:

Chenrui Liu
Renxuan Pang
Ronnie Woo

# Intentions:

We will make an interpreter that can read Brainfuck, and output the results as intended. 

# Intended usage:

The user will be able to just use the makefile in the terminal to convert brainfuck to human-readable format. 

# Technical Details:

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

The interpreter plays into the role of stegnography through obfuscating plain text into brainfuck and converting the other way around. 
It is essentially a type of cipher that uses the programming language instead of a set key.

Our group will likely split the work very simply by making the interpreter in a different language each. 

# Intended pacing:

The first week will be used to try to finish the majority of project, if pacing goes well we will do something extra/snazzy for the second week.
