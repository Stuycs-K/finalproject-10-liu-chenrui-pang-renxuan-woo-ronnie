# Final Project Proposal

Brainfuck Interpreter (in java)

## Group Members:

Chenrui Liu
Renxuan Pang
Ronnie Woo

# Intentions:

We will make Brainfuck encoding-decoding tools as well as a Visualizer to see the process. 

# Intended usage:

The user will be able to use these tools to encode plaintext (or files) into brainfuck as well as decode brainfuck into plaintext. 
The user will be able to use the Visualizer to see brainfuck commands act actively and Visualize the process. 

# Technical Details:

The interpreter plays into the role of stegnography through obfuscation, turning plain text into a form that is a lot less human readable. 
It is essentially a type of cipher that uses the programming language instead of a set key.

Furthermore we are dealing with symmetrical encoding here, what we encoded will also be able to be decoded back into human readable data. 

We are breaking down the project into 3 parts:
- Chenrui will be making the Encoder
- Ronnie will be making the Decoder
- Renxuan will be making the Visualizer

# Intended pacing:

The first week will be used to try to finish up the majority of the project, we should have a MVP after the first week. 
The second week will be used for debugging and trying to add extra features like file modes or optimizing the GUI.
